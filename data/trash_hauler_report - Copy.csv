Once again the Waste Industries crew left my trash cart in the right- of -way of a school zone. I?m sure that the crew knows right from wrong and this behavior is repeatedly wrong.

February 14, 2018 (On February 21st I gave them the benefit of no supervision and didn?t report them),February 28 and today March 7. Please help? I shouldn?t have keep calling for managers assistance to a hazardous situation.

75429,6/14/2018,Trash Collection Complaint,"Hello,
This week on my trash day, Wednesday, I heard a loud sound in the alley - which was my garbage can being destroyed - either by the recycling truck, or the garbage truck.  They then left my trash behind.  It ripped the mud flap from the truck.  The mud flap left behind is laying on top of the crushed garbage can (and trash still inside)- all are still in the alley.  It was run over and the wheels/axel are broken.  My cart is always put away, except when I pull it to the edge on trash morning.  The can was not sitting in the alley-way;  It was pulled up to the edge.  As you can see by my yard, I am a very neat person, and keep our alley clean.  This is very upsetting.  Trash can ID: Z0224202

I have to move garbage cans in my alley just so I can get out of my driveway and not hit 6 cans.
I have requested in the past that the garbage cans be returned to an upright position and THE LIDS CLOSED! Leaving the lids open allows for mosquitoes to breed freely and encourages rodents. 
If the cans were returned to their upright position and closed, this would cut down on the cost of maintaining the cans and the service. It would also help mitigate other expenses related to mosquito and rodent control.

88014,8/5/2018,Trash Collection Complaint,"It's unfortunate, but we are used to the trash trucks spilling vile liquids along the street almost every week. We pray for rain to wash the stench and ""stains"" on the street after each trash pickup. I've been told that nothing can be done about the vile liquid. Last Wednesday, the trash truck also dropped solids as it traveled down my street. Those solids get eaten by wild animals, but are also eaten by household pets (dogs, cats, etc.). I'm hoping my dog doesn't get sick as a result. Last Wednesday, the trash truck also dropped broken glass as it traveled down the street. I've picked up between 50 and 100 pieces as I walked my dog, and I still see pieces on the ground days later. The glass is small enough to get caught in the paw of a dog or cat, and can cause injury. 
Why can't the trucks be ""sealed"" so they don't discharge the vile liquid, solids or broken glass? My neighbors and I want our trash picked up, but we don't appreciate the unnecessary side effects. I have samples of the glass if anyone cares to see them. Or, you can just walk the street and see for yourself.","5411 Oakmont Cir, Nashville, TN 37209, United States",37209,RED RIVER,2301,24,1717152.329,658957.5812

I have a backdoor waiver and need someone to contact me by phone or email as soon as possible so this can be resolved. There are cans in my yard below my deck. I use my own can on the deck to keep trash in then drop it below into those cans. They are both full (I believe, unless there is only one can out there... I am currently sick and can't go out to look) as is the one on the deck and the rest of the trash is either in bags on the deck (which is a mess now because I think they've had animals get in them) and in my kitchen. I do have a gate but it is always unlocked and open and going through it to get to my backyard has never been an issue before. But since I renewed the waiver I have yet to be able to get anyone to pick up at all. Please help!

139002,2/7/2019,Trash Collection Complaint,"My trash wasn't picked up yesterday.  I found a note on the ground stating not to bag recycle.  There was nothing on the list of things not to be included (leaves, debris, etc.).  The only thing I can think of is a furnace filter that is cardboard but the interior is metal that I don't think is supposed to go in recycle.  There was a chickfilet bag containing the garbage from a meal.  It was basically garbage.  I also had a note on on my recycle.  The only thing I can figure is we did bag the paper from our shredder in a plastic garbage bag.  

I have gone through the list of acceptable and not and think we are abiding, but evidently someone thinks differently than I.  Can I have a place to go for more guidance or this is going to be a continual issue.

I pay taxes for this service and expect it to be picked up.

Thank you,

I live in a  flashing light school zone of McKissack Middle School  and Metro School buses can't turn into or exit 38th Ave N with our cart left in the right-of-way.  The buses are approximately 45ft, (13.7m) long This is a hazard for the child pedestrians walking to and from school as well as for the bus drivers. Please ask the crew to replace the cart from where they got it (out of the right-of-way)? The crews had been doing well for months (no complaints). Encourage them to tighten up and do-the-right thing. If they don't I'll have to complain every week and escalate the ticket to upper management. It takes less effort to put the cart away than to be negligent and cause traffic accidents or children ran over.

May you be Healthy and Safe!
May your Cart Crews be safe and professional.

My senior citizen mom has back yard service. This would be the 2nd time that this  mistake has happen for not getting her back yard trash. I don?t give too craps if your low/ on staff or new hires and their  forgetting to pick up her trash in the back. Or is it the fact that their lazy to do the job? It?s been  several occasions where I came to  visit and her can wasn?t push back in it?s  original backyard spot and I had to do it. What if my mother didn?t have  children? Who would take the  initiative to roll her bin back? The  garbage workers could care less. I shouldn?t have to call or place tickets regarding trash!!!! This is  Ludacris!!!!

When I arrived home after work, I immediately noticed that my phone/cable line, along with at least 3 of me neighbors homes, was cut and laying on the ground in our front yards. After speaking with another neighbor, it would appear the metro  dump truck caught hold of the line and ripped it down causing an outage.  Can someone please come out to our street and raise both the cable and electrical lines so that this doesn't happen again? Also, on another note, I wanted to note that the street lights on our street, Theresa Avenue, are very dim.

It is absolutely disgusting and unsanitary and unsafe to have trash liquid all over the streets. It is at every trash stop (every house) that there is a smelly nasty liquid in the street. We can't walk our dog on trash days because there is also glass spilled and trash left behind.

I would enjoy if the crew would simply return the cart to where they got it from, off the street, not on the curb and beyond the sidewalk adjacent to the fire hydrant.  This location clears the street for school buses and the sidewalk for pedestrians. In addition ask them to close the lid on the cart.  All work is honorable and I have the utmost respect for their efforts but now the crew acts like they don't don't pay the supervisors or citizens any attention. They are two feet from earning excellent  satisfaction ratings.  Instead they are earning extremely unsatisfied feedback. So to better serve my family return the cart to where they pick it up and close the lid. Thank you.","3709 Batavia St, Nashville, TN 37209, United States",37209,WASTE IND,3307,21,1723507,665456.2023

All of them were returned to the ground with their lids open and many of them were dropped on their side(not upright).  All prior trashtrucks and drivers took the time to return and safely lower the empty trashcans to upright position and make sure the lids were closed.  This is important due to rain and wear and tear on the trashcans.

212428,7/9/2019,Trash Collection Complaint,"Hello,
Writing in because I think the truck that came to my neighborhood may need some attention. As soon as I turned onto 28th Ave N. coming home from work, I smelled trash liquid. If you look at the location of my house, you can see a drive that separates the two rows of homes. That's where we put out the carts on trash day. There was a clear trail of stinky trash liquid running the length of that drive with puddles where the truck must have paused. On those puddles, flies were gathering so they were definitely the source of the smell. I did my best to dilute and hose away the puddles and trails but I couldn't get it all and I certainly couldn't wash up the street. -- I don't know much at all about how garbage trucks work but I don't think they're supposed to leak garbage water like that. 

Please have the truck cleaned/repaired before next week if possible. 

Thank you and have a good day,
Ben Hoback.","1917 28th Ave N, Nashville, TN 37208, United States",37208,METRO,9201,21,1725614.532,674846.6403

241803,9/4/2019,Trash - Curbside/Alley Missed Pickup,"Good Afternoon,
We recently purchased this property and the seller/former owner of the home unfortunately used recycling containers as their trash cans. We put signs on the cans Thursday evening prior to Friday's trash pick up trying to help identify that the items in the bins were trash and not recycling. Also, since we are moving, unpacking, etc. we have some items next the cans that need to be picked up as trash. Once we have a clean slate and everything is picked up, we will be able to dispose of trash and recycling as desired. Currently, we don't have any room to put anything other than on the ground next to the cans. 

Thank you,

Today the driver slammed my can down really hard, sent the can flying then he ran over it. The driver doesn?t wait for the items to fall from the can but flips it up and them back down with no hesitation to allow all the trash bags to travel from the bottom of the can. I have picked up trash for weeks now that falls from the truck while he is picking up my trash. The truck appears to be too full so when he adds items  many items fall off the truck. I just recommend the driver receive additional training. I realize the city will replace damaged trash cans but it is at us taxpayers expense.
